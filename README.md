Eat the Burgers is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has an eat it icon. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Every burger is stored in a database, whether devoured or not.

Use of Node and MysSQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

This app follows the MVC design pattern: Model, View, Controller.
